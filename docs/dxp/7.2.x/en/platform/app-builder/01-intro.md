# App Builder

## Custom Objects

Deleting fields from the custom object
Deleting, updating custom objects

## Form Views

As many form views as desired per object
Removing a field from a form view

## Table Views

As many table views as desired per object

Table views are the default view for the app. If there's a form, there will be an add button to add records using the form
If there are no entries, the user simply sees "No entries yet"

Search
Detail view (shows all fields for the record, not just the ones include din the table view)
From the table view, users with permissions to manage records will see the kebab menu (even in a standalone app)
Can also go directly to the next detail view with the next arrow


## App Management
Widgets can show both views (form and table), or only one view (form OR table)--done via the widget menu
A standalone app or admin app always shows both form and table view (defaults to table view with an add button to access the form)

The app can be updated at any time after its initial deployment, including deleting the app, undeploying it, or editing any of the three main components: form view, table view, and deployment options. 

Open the app at its standalone link using the kebab menu in the Apps tab

App permission over deleting, updating, creating the app's entries

App permissions over the apps themselves (defined for the custom object or even above that, at the app builder level?)
