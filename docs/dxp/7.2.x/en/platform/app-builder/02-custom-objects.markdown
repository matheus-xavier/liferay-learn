## Creating a Custom Object

To create custom objects, 

1.  Navigate to Control Panel &rarr; App Builder &rarr; Custom Objects, and click the add button.

2.  Enter a name for the object.

3.  To create a form view for the object and define the data fields present in the object, leave the _Continue and Create Form View_ setting checked and click _Continue_.

Define the data present in your Custom Object by creating a Form View.

## Creating Form Views

Once you're ready to define the data handled by your Custom Object, write as many Form Views as is needed for the application. The Form Views collect the fields of the Custom Object. They're populated by the application's Users filling out the forms they encounter.

To create form views,

1.  Open the Custom Object (Control Panel &rarr; App Builder &rarr; Custom Objects).

2.  From the _Form Views_ tab, click the Add button.

    The Form Builder is displayed.
